# Project Summary – Student Math Performance Prediction

This project was developed as part of a machine learning coursework assignment. The aim was to use supervised learning models to predict whether a student would pass or fail their final math exam based on their background, academic record, and behavior.

### ✅ Key Points

- Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook
- Models applied: Decision Tree (with pruning), KNN, and SVM
- Dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Evaluation included multiple performance metrics for fairness
- Final results compared test accuracy across all models

This project demonstrates understanding of classification techniques, evaluation strategies, and model tuning (e.g., pruning, scaling, best K-value search).
